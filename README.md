# Player Cheating Behavior in PubG
### Grade: Distinction

---

Using computational thinking and programming skills to understand user behavior around cheating in the online PubG game using digital trace data for a Python Fundamentals course assignment.

In the assignment, we will study the homophily and social contagion of cheating in the massive multiplayer online game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG). Cheating in this context means the adoption of unapproved software that gives the player an unfair advantage in the game (e.g. being able to see through walls).

Our hypotheses are that cheaters tend to associate with other cheaters but also, players who interact with cheaters become likely to adopt cheating themselves.
